    - pip install requests == 2.1.3
    - pip install requests >=2, <3
    - pip install requests ~= 2.1.3
        - any 2.1.X version >= 2.1.3

- pip list --outdate 
    - For looking at outdated packages
- pip3 install --upgrade requests
    - For upgrading to the latest version of requests for example
